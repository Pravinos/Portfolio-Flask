        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>My name is Thomas Kyriakos Pravinos, I am 23 years old and I live in Thessaloniki, Greece.
            <br><br>
            Currently, I am pursuing a Integrated Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH). Before attending university, I obtained my High School Diploma from 1st General High School of Alexandreia. Along the way, I have earned a number of certifications and have completed various projects for my university classes. I completed a 3-month internship as an Full Stack Developer-Engineer, at MyCompany Projects. During this time, I contributed to a Laravel project focused on pressure vessels and their functions, working alongside experienced developers who taught me the fundamentals of Laravel and Vue.js. With their guidance, I developed a structured approach to problem-solving, enabling me to tackle complex technical issues independently. This experience helped me grow both as a person and a developer. In July of 2023 I joined SpaceDot, my university's Cubesat team and as a new member I'm working on my thesis, which is about Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery for the subsystems of the AcubeSAT nanosatelitte using embedded programming.
            <br><br>
            I am eager to continue learning and growing both personally and professionally, and am excited to explore opportunities to apply my skills to new and exciting projects.</p>
