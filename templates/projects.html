            <h2>"Finding subject areas for scientific articles based on their titles and abstracts" - Network/Graph Theory</h2>
            <p>This assignment was about finding subject areas for approximately 20,000 scientific articles, given their titles and abstracts. The data is provided in a CSV file and includes columns indicating whether each article belongs to various subject areas such as Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, etc. The goal is to create a network graph of the articles, with edges representing how relevant pairs of articles are to each other, and to examine whether the resulting communities in the network correspond to the given subject areas. The correlation between articles can be calculated using a language model that provides sentence embeddings, and the precision of the results will be evaluated based on how well they match the given subject areas.</p>

            <h2>"Database Design and Web Application Development Project" - DataBases</h2>
            <p>We designed a database in MySQL and developed a web application using Laravel to provide video streaming analytics.

                To accomplish this, we designed a database schema that could store data about video streams and viewers, and implemented the database using MySQL. I then developed a basic web application using Laravel that connected to the database and provided analytics for video streams. This involved implementing features that allowed users to view analytics data and other useful stats like post impressions,liked videos etc.
                
                Through completing this project, we demonstrated our understanding of database design and web application development using Laravel and MySQL, as well as my ability to create a functional web application that provides useful analytics data for video streams. I am excited to continue applying these skills and knowledge in future projects and opportunities.
                
                This was a group project , and the team was composed of my two co-students Dimitrios, Anastasia and me. We all together designed the Database and its functions and later with the skills I developed in my internship I created a basic web app to connect our DB. This was a project for class ''DataBases'' of the winter semester of 2022-23.</p>
